Start at position 3.\n2. Move right to position 4.\n3. Move left to position 5.\n4. Continue moving left until you reach position z (which is represented by e in our diagram).\n5. Count the total number of steps taken to reach position z.\n\nNow, let's count the steps:\n\n- From position 3 to position 4: 1 step\n- From position 4 to position 5: 1 step\n- From position 5 to position z (position e): 2 steps\n\nTotal steps: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required to navigate from '3' to 'z' is 4.\n\nThe reasoning behind this solution is that we need to move left from 3 to 4, then move left from 4 to 5, and finally move left from 5 to the last position (position z). Since there are two positions between these moves (positions 4 and 5), we add one more step for each of those positions. In total, we take 4 steps, which matches our initial calculation."}]}
